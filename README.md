# üêß rlxos

**rlxos** is an experimental Linux distribution built **purely in Go**, without relying on the traditional **GNU/Linux stack**. It uses **direct syscalls** with CGO disabled (`CGO_ENABLED=0`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning: Highly Experimental**
> This project is in a very early **proof-of-concept (POC)** stage. The codebase is **inefficient**, and there are **known memory and resource leaks**. Do **not** use this for anything other than **learning** or **experimentation**.

## üöÄ Motivation

The goal of `rlxos` is simple but ambitious:

* **Explore a new system stack** for Linux-based operating systems.
* **Understand how things work** by building a minimal OS environment using just Go and raw syscalls.
* Challenge conventional toolchains and eliminate dependency on C libraries and the GNU ecosystem.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

To build and run `rlxos`, you'll need the following:

* [Go](https://go.dev) 1.24+

Install supporting packages:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential rsync wget squashfs-tools flex bison bc qemu-system-x86 libssl-dev libelf-dev
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmanjeet/rlxos.git
cd rlxos
```

### 2. Ingite the build

```bash
go run rlxos.dev/tools/ignite -device generic-amd64
```

### 3. Test your build with Qemu emulator
```bash
go run rlxos.dev/tools/ignite -device generic-amd64 -test
```

### Configure build and test process with available options

```bash
Usage of rlxos.dev/tools/ignite:
  -cache-path string
        Cache path
  -clean
        Clean build targets
  -cpu int
        number of CPU for enumlation (default 1)
  -debug
        Wait for debugger to connect
  -device string
        Device path
  -kernel string
        Specify kernel version (default "6.15.4")
  -memory int
        memory allocated for emulation (in MBs) (default 512)
  -project-path string
        Project path (default "/home/itsmanjeet/rlxos")
  -test
        run test
  -vnc int
        VNC port (default -1)
```

## üß© Adding New Commands

To add a new command in `rlxos`:

1. Create your command under the `./cmd/<Command-Name>` directory.
2. Register it by adding to one of the following:

   * **Global**: Add `cmd/<COMMAND-NAME>` to the `SYSTEM_TARGETS +=` line in the main `Makefile` or `./config.mk`.
   * **Device-specific**: Add it to the `SYSTEM_TARGETS +=` section in `./devices/<DEVICE>/config.mk`.

This helps keep builds modular and flexible.
