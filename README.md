### What is Limine?

Limine (pronounced as demonstrated [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/in%20limine))
is a modern, advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader and boot manager, also used
as the reference implementation for the [Limine boot protocol](https://codeberg.org/Limine/limine-protocol/src/branch/trunk/PROTOCOL.md).

## Packaging status

All Limine releases since 7.x use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for their naming.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/limine.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/limine/versions)

## Binary releases

For convenience, for point releases, binaries are distributed. These binaries
are shipped in the `-binary` branches and tags of this repository
(see [branches](https://codeberg.org/Limine/Limine/branches) and
[tags](https://codeberg.org/Limine/Limine/tags)).

For example, to clone the latest binary release of the `10.x` branch, one can do:
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/Limine/Limine.git --branch=v10.x-binary --depth=1
```
or, to clone a specific binary point release (for example `10.3.2`):
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/Limine/Limine.git --branch=v10.3.2-binary --depth=1
```

In order to rebuild host utilities like `limine`, simply run `make` in the binary
release directory.

Host utility binaries are provided for Windows.
