    *** Release 10.3.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.3.1:

    CI-related changes, otherwise, same as 10.3.1.

2025-11-23  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.3.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.3.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix wrong virtual address related constants, for the loongarch64
          port, that made Limine-protocol kernels fail to boot.
        - Fix issue that caused the MBR ID in the Limine boot protocol
          limine_file structure to always be 0.

2025-11-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.3.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.2.1:

    **Special notes:**
        Despite there being breaking changes in this release, no major version
        bump is done; this is because the changes are minor enough, there are
        no big new features, and version 10.x was not released long enough ago.
        This is technically in violation of Semantic Versioning, but considered
        to be an acceptable exception.

    Breaking changes:
        - Change default paths and default path ordering for configuration file
          search. Mainly, search first for a configuration file in the same
          directory as the EFI application file of Limine, on EFI ports.
        - Change default path ordering for stage 3 file search on BIOS ports.
        - No longer install the limine.h header file on the host.
        - No longer install PROTOCOL.md (Limine Boot Protocol specification) on
          the host.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix an issue where code assumed that the RSDT address in the RSDP was
          always non-NULL, which could cause crashes or hangs when using base
          revision 4 of the Limine Boot Protocol.

2025-10-29  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.2.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.2.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Add workaround for skipping SPI flash devices exposed as EFI volumes.
          This fixes the hanging issues on many ARM laptops, without breaking
          U-Boot unlike the previous workaround.

2025-10-26  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.2.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.1.1:

    New features:
        - Implement base revision 4 of the Limine boot protocol as per
          documentation (read documentation for specific details).

    Bug fixes:
        - "Fix" multiboot1 framebuffer structure to match GRUB instead of the
          multiboot1 specification.

2025-10-13  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.1.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.1.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - DTBs: Always reallocate DTBs to bootloader-reclaimable memory. This
          is to prevent pointers to EFI/reserved memory from being leaked to
          Limine protocol executables, which is against said protocol, which
          mandates that DTBs have to be in bootloader-reclaimable memory.

2025-10-05  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.1.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.0.1:

    New features:
        - Expand safety checks of the `limine bios-install` command and replace
          the `--force-mbr` flag with just `--force`.
        - Add autodetection of the BIOS boot partition if no explicit partition
          index is passed to `limine bios-install`.

    Bug fixes:
        - Only use ASCII characters for terminal output when graphical output
          fails to initialise and the EFI standard output console is used
          instead.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Remove left-over logic that was meant to supplement the removed GPT
          embedding feature.
        - Remove workaround to allow building the RISC-V port with LLVM <=16.
        - Update a bunch of output messages from the `limine` host tool.

2025-09-21  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.0.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 10.0.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix a potential use-after-free issue when flushing interrupts on x86
          UEFI systems.
        - Prefer using the 32-bit Linux protocol unless it is strictly
          necessary to use the 64-bit protocol due to allocation constraints.
          This is due to reports of the 32-bit protocol being more reliable
          on certain rare systems where the 64-bit protocol crashes or hangs.

2025-09-15  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 10.0.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.7:

    Breaking changes:
        - GPT embedding is no longer supported as a deployment method for
          GPT-with-BIOS configurations. The rationale for this being that it is
          far too fragile, especially with regards to growing or shrinking disk
          images, and it may cause certain machines to refuse to boot such
          setups as they are technically in violation of the GPT specification.
        - The default baud rate for serial I/O on BIOS systems is now 115200,
          instead of 9600.
        - BIOS (chainloading) boot menu entries are now hidden when booting in
          UEFI mode, and EFI (chainloading) entries are hidden when booting in
          BIOS mode.
        - For the Limine boot protocol, for relocatable executables, KASLR now
          defaults to being disabled. The rationale for this being that KASLR
          is a somewhat niche and fairly bypassable security technique, which
          can cause headaches for kernels not wanting to support it, and make
          troubleshooting harder.
        - For the Limine boot protocol, for PE format kernels, do not discard
          discardable sections, as code put to a discardable section like INIT
          might be intended to only be discarded after early kernel init, not
          before the kernel is even loaded.

2025-09-13  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.7 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.6:

    Bug fixes:
        - Relax EFI handle validation before running fallback volume detection.
          This further addresses issues caused by 9.5.4.

2025-09-06  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.6 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.5:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix regression introduced by 9.5.4 that caused Limine to fail to boot
          with U-Boot.

2025-08-30  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.3 through 9.6.5 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.2:

    These are special hotfix releases attempting to address issues with the
    Forgejo release workflow after the migration to Codeberg.

    Other than that, they have no differences compared to 9.6.2.

2025-08-30  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.1:

    Miscellaneous:
        - The Limine project has moved its home to Codeberg.
        - Nyu-EFI was rebranded to PicoEFI.
        - Minor build system improvements and subproject bumps.

2025-08-16  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.6.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - EFI chainloading: Make EFI device path of loaded image relative to
          the loaded image device handle. This now complies with the EFI
          specification, and, amongst others, it fixes chainloading Shim.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system changes and improvements.
        - Do not disable linker relaxations for LoongArch64.
        - `limine` host tool: Add check to ensure that a provided GPT BIOS
          partition is at least 32KiB in size.

2025-08-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.6.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.4:

    Miscellaneous:
        - Get rid of the fragile and messy "freestanding-toolchain" build
          helper tool. This allows for a simpler and more predictable way of
          selecting the target toolchain components via ./configure.

2025-08-06  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.4 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.3:

    Bug fixes:
        - Exclude non-PCI devices from the volume discovery process on UEFI.
          This is because on (especially, but not limited to) Snapdragon X
          systems, firmware/flash devices, which are non-PCI, are exposed as
          block I/O volumes too. This skips them, which makes the bootloader
          more reliable and avoids long hangs at boot.
        - Miscellaneous changes and fixes to the fallback volume discovery
          path, to increase reliability and reduce the chance of accidental
          damage or data loss. See GitHub issue #525.
        - Minor assembly improvement that fixed Limine not building with old
          NASM.

2025-08-04  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Miscellaneous build system fixes, mainly to sort out possible issues
          introduced by 9.5.2.

2025-08-01  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Revert change that moved to `nm` from `objdump` for generating the
          symbol table, as that broke section-specific symbol dumps and caused
          BIOS stage 2 to be bloated with the full symbol table.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

2025-07-29  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Unbreak build using ld.gold as linker.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

2025-07-14  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.4.0:

    New features:
        - protocols/efi: Hybridise loading mechanism with old memory-device
          based approach. This may work around the redundant requirement that
          EFI applications be signed, and it may fix certain issues created
          when the chainload mechanism was changed in 9.0.1.

    Bug fixes:
        - `limine` host tool: Fix some mismatched printf format specifiers.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.
        - Many dependencies had their commits bumped, some new dependencies
          were added (limine-protocol), some were changed (libfdt moved to a
          different repository that only includes BSD-2-Clause licensable
          code).

2025-07-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.4.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.4:

    New features:
        - BLI: Implement `LoaderTimeInitUSec` and `LoaderTimeExecUSec`.
          These are variables used by `systemd-analyze` and are useful for boot
          performance metrics.
        - Limine boot protocol: Add bootloader performance feature.
          This feature provides the same information as the new Boot Loader
          Interface variables, but encoded in a nicer way for Limine protocol
          executables.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Use `nm` instead of `objdump` for generating the symbol table, which
          results in a better, more consistent output, especially for non-x86
          architectures.
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

2025-06-21  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.4 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.3:

    Bug fixes:
        - ELF: Make an optimisation related to skipping scanning of .bss
          regions for finding of structures in the loaded image (for Limine
          protocol structures or otherwise) less overeager as that could break
          in certain cases.
        - SMP: On x86, ensure that the value of IA32_APIC_BASE is the same on
          the APs as it is on the BSP.
        - PMM: Mark EfiLoader{Code,Data} regions as bootloader reclaimable
          rather than reserved memory, as for certain protocols, like the
          Limine boot protocol, reserved memory is unmapped at runtime, while
          these regions may contain hot data that is still needed, like Limine
          bootloader memory stacks.

2025-05-27  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Reinstate the limit for scanned drives to 0xf0. This is due to a
          report of int 13h hangs when used on drives >=0xf0.

2025-05-19  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - PMM: Mark EfiBootServices{Code,Data} memory regions as bootloader
          reclaimable instead of usable free memory as apparently the ACPI
          and UEFI specifications make no guarantees about useful structures
          being left in these areas after leaving boot services (namely BGRT
          and ESRT).

2025-05-15  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Remove .git directory mistakenly left over inside release tarballs.
        - Fix bug that would lead to panics when booting Linux protocol kernels
          without modules on x86.

2025-05-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.3:

    New features:
        - Add optional support for the 64-bit x86-64 boot protocol for Linux.
          This is supported on the UEFI/x86-64 port of Limine, and it is
          preferred over the 32-bit boot protocol if supported by the given
          kernel. This helps with loading larger modules on certain systems
          with low amounts of low memory which would otherwise panic.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix away some ungraceful handling of out-of-memory situations when
          loading files using the Linux boot protocol. Make into panics instead
          of crashes or hangs.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Improve performance and memory usage of loading modules for the Linux
          boot protocol.

2025-04-12  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix issues introduced by the stb_image fix introduced in 9.2.1 which
          could cause hangs or crashes when certain wallpaper images are used.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Update cc-runtime to new, integer-only, packed version.

2025-03-31  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Two quick bug fixes and workarounds in order to make multiboot2 more
          resilient when booting specific kernels such as Xen.
        - Avoid mistakenly allocating more memory than necessary when creating
          the volume index.

2025-03-25  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix potential buffer overflow bug with our stb_image support code.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Dynamically allocate volume index instead of relying on a hard coded
          limit and a fixed allocation. This fixes potential panics or failure
          to access volumes on systems with a lot of drives/partitions.
        - Limine boot protocol/ELF: Print the name of unresolved symbols on
          panic.

2025-03-16  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.3:

    New features:
        - Introduce initial support for the Boot Loader Interface
          specification.
        - Add /EFI/limine/limine.conf to the paths tried for config file when
          using EFI.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Do not try config path /EFI/BOOT/limine.conf unless booted using EFI.

2025-03-13  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Loongarch64: Fix alignment of TLB-refill handler.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Many fixes and improvements to documentation, installed or otherwise,
          including further licensing clarifications.

2025-03-11  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.1:

    This release does not change anything code-wise, but rather it focuses on
    sorting out the licensing mess of Nyu-EFI, by updating it to the latest
    revision which tackles this problem, and furthermore it improves the
    COPYING file to be more explicit about submodules and their licensing.

2025-03-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Do not use ConOut for serial output exclusively unless serial is
          verified to be present to the best of our abilities. This fixes an
          issue where if `serial=yes` is used on some machines (including
          several Apple Mac models) a black screen will be shown instead of the
          Limine menu.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Begin signing tarballs and (most) commits.

2025-03-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.0.1:

    New features:
        - `limine` host tool: When using the `bios-install` command on an
          ISOHYBRID with a GPT, automatically convert it to MBR, if possible
          and unless explicitly disabled, in order to enhance compatibility of
          said ISOHYBRIDs with many systems (of note, Lenovo Thinkpads).

2025-02-25  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.0.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.0.0:

    Miscellaneous:
        - EFI chainload: Replace old chainload method with one that is more
          friendly to other EFI bootloaders such as rEFInd.
        - Limine boot protocol/PE: Map previously unmapped PE image headers.

2025-02-17  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.0.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.7.0:

    Breaking changes:
        - Support for the ext2/3/4 filesystems has been once again dropped due
          to lack of maintenance and to avoid extra potential attack surface
          during Secure Boot Limine usage.
        - Drop support for the legacy config format (limine.cfg) and only keep
          around the new one (limine.conf) introduced with Limine 8.x.
        - Drop support for the (barely worked and seldom used) `chainload_next`
          protocol.

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Introduce API revision 3, for the `limine.h`
          file with several renamed identifiers for better clarity.
        - Limine boot protocol: Specify and implement a new, convenience,
          "Executable Command Line feature".
        - Limine boot protocol: Use monitor/mwait CPU instructions, when
          available, to reduce CPU usage and increase performance during
          multiprocessor initialisation.
        - Add preferred aliases for BIOS and EFI chainload (namely `bios` and
          `efi`) protocol names for the `protocol` config option.

    Bug fixes:
        - EFI (chainload) boot protocol: Fix `path` option alias not working.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Update Flanterm submodule to latest.

2025-01-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.7.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.6.1:

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Add support for PE executables.
        - Linux boot protocol: Enable support for Loongarch64.
        - Add support for selecting a random wallpaper every boot if multiple
          are provided.
        - Add `path` aliases for `kernel_path` and `image_path` for the Linux
          and EFI Chainloading protocols respectively.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Submodule version/commit bumps.

2024-12-26  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.6.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.6.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Propagate EFI PXE device handle properly when chainloading.
        - Ensure that, when specifying a `dtb_path`, extra space is properly
          allocated just as is done for EFI-provided DTBs.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Linux on RISCs: General code clean up; pass EFI memory map and initrd
          information as EFI configuration tables alongside already passed DTB
          parameters for the same, in preparation for loongarch64 support.

2024-12-05  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.6.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.5.0:

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Specify and implement new "RISC-V BSP Hart ID"
          feature.
        - Limine boot protocol: Add a new "SBI" firmware type to the firmware
          type feature
        - Limine boot protocol: Add a new API revision 2 to the limine.h header
          file. This replaces many mentions of 'kernel' with a more neutral

          load addresses at or around 0, instead slide them all the way to the
          topmost 2GiB (0xffffffff80000000). This allows setting a base load
          address of 0 in LD BFD/LLD linker scripts which makes LD BFD (the
          default GNU LD) actually emit an ELF with ET_DYN type.

    Bug fixes:
        - multiboot2 protocol: Do not panic if there is a ENTRY_ADDRESS_EFI64

          useful error message.
        - Avoid usage of reserved C identifiers in certain cases.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Drop usage of "libgcc-binaries" for "cc-runtime". This finally makes
          us able to ship Limine tarballs without included binary blobs, and
          should improve compatibility with more obscure toolchain set ups.
