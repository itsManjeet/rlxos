# rlxos GNU/Linux

(rlxos, pronounced as "r-e-l-e-a-x" or "r-l-x-o-s")
An Independent, __Safely Mutable__, and Privacy oriented rolling release Linux distribution, developed from scratch, with focus on making a usable __Immutable__ distribution.

- The `Ostree` provides a git like model to manage root file system. And ensure safe and atomic transition between different versions.
- [Xfce4](https://www.xfce.org) a lightweight desktop environment that is fast, beautiful and highly customizable.
- [Swupd](./system-management/updates.md) fast, simple, in-house developed package manager, which provides a safe way to add layers/packages without breaking system.
  
rlxos is developed by a handful of developers in their spare time and is generally considered stable enough for daily use.
