# Factory reset

> Factory reset, also known as hard reset or master reset, is a software restore of an electronic device to its original system state by erasing all the information stored on the device. A keyboard input button factory reset is used to restore the device to its original manufacturer settings.

Factory reset will delete the **cache** layer and system with boot into the initial setup stage.

It is recommended to create a new profile (or **cache** layer) instead of deleting the previous one (that might contain data you need)
