# Switching channel

By default, you are provided with the stable channel, which releases updates once a month after ensuring the stability of changes.

To switch update channels, use:

`updatectl update --channel <arch>/os/<channel>`

Execute the following command to view all available channels:

`updatectl list --all`

Channels following the pattern `<arch>/os/<channel>` are base channels.
